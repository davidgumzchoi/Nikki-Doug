          	<h3>Douglas An</h3>
            <p>I don't know if Nikki remembers the first time we met, but it was at our church's annual retreat. She was standing waiting in line to get prayed by a pastor, and I had just come up and stood right in front of her (obviously an honest mistake because I'm a good human being).  She tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "get in line" (as she crinkled her face in annoyance).</p>
            <p>The first time I met Nikki, I must say, was quite different from the lovey-dovey cloud 9 love at first sight. The way she caught my eye was with her confidence. We were able to drive together after a birthday in the east bay - the first real conversation we shared. We parked outside her apartment sat in my car for about an hour just talking - goals, aspirations, career, etc. I knew then - I wanted to get to know her better.</p>
            <p>Soon thereafter, I had the opportunity to pick her up from Fullerton to drive back up to San Francisco. We got a chance to share a conversation, until meeting up with the other people that we were supposed to drive up with. I felt such an urge to get to know her. I felt compassion over her immediately and I wanted to finally ask her on a date. The more I got to know her the more I fell in love with her.</p>
            <p>Fast forward a couple months. We decided to wait until March to officially date, and once that day came, I knew right away - I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person. It wasn't what she looks like, her desires, her interests. No, it was all icing on the cake. I knew the way I felt about her was real. I knew that I couldn't let her go, and envisioning my life without her was impossible.</p>
            <p>So, on May 24th, I proposed to her on Mount Tamapais, where we went on our first date, in front of her mom and friends.</p>
            <p>I'm excited for us to continue to write our story as we enter into the next chapter of life together.</p>

			  		<h4>Bride</h4>
			  		<h3>Nikki Lee</h3>
			  		<p>Doug and I met at church and got to know each other better during our drive up from SoCal to San Francisco after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Since I don't have a car in SoCal, Doug graciously offered to pick me up from home to drive up together with other church friends. When Doug was on his way, I decided to prep my mom and let her know that a boy was coming over to the Lee household since she can be overbearing at times. I let her know that Doug was just a buddy giving me a lift, and nothing more. But as soon as Doug met my mom, my mom whispered in my ear and said, "He seems like such a good boy.  I've always wanted you to be with a guy like that." My heart secretly melted then.</p> 
	          <p>One of my prayer requests for my future husband has always been to meet someone who can love my mom and vice versa. My mom is such an important person in my life so I wanted someone who can share that special bond and join in our family. Since our long drive up to San Francisco, Doug has been fully committed in getting to know me and in working on our relationship. I was skeptical at first but the more I got to know him, the more I couldn't believe how God brought the very person with qualities I had always prayed for in my future husband. It still amazes me at times how God answered my prayer on even the most detailed aspects of Doug's characteristics.</p>
	          <p>As one of our first dates, we went for a day snowboarding/ski trip to Tahoe. We were excited for the long drive of us getting to know each other better and ski and snowboard since we both haven't done so in a long time. However during our first run down, Doug fell and hit his head against a pile of ice and went into a concussion. He was carried down the mountain on a toboggan by the first aid patrols and we soon ended up in the ER nearby. I was obviously worried as I was sitting in the ER waiting room, but as tears were coming down my face, I realized I cared for him a lot and loved him. We became "official" that day in the ER. Looking back, funny how everything worked out. I used to always wonder why God hadn't sent me someone already. I now know why it took so long - because He had Doug in store for me.</p>

								<tr><td>Herie Pang (Matron of Honor)</td></tr>
								<!--
								I met Herie six years old ago in SoCal and rekindled the friendship when I moved to San Francisco.  As a wife and a mother of two, Herie has been like a sister that I never had - praying for and always looking out for each other.  We currently attend church together in San Francisco.
								-->
								<tr><td>Elena Chung</td></tr>
								<!--
								Elena and I met 12 years ago on a study abroad program in Korea and have been friends ever since!  Elena is one of the few friends that has seen me transform throughout my 20's.  Doug should really thank Elena for recruiting Nikki to San Francisco by landing her a job at Del Monte!
								-->
								<tr><td>Joanna Ahearn</td></tr>
								<!--
								I met Joanna in Cabarete, Dominican Republic five years ago.  We had both just gotten into Kellogg Business School and didn't know anyone on the school trip.  When we sat next to each other on the bus ride, we instantly connected and haven't let go of each other ever since!  Joanna has been such an awesome, supportive friend through, especially during my tough transition of living so far away from home in Chicago.
								-->
								<tr><td>Jung Park</td></tr>
								<!--
								Jung and Ii have been long distance friends ever since we first met in Berkeley back in 2002.  While Jung lived in Washington D.C. and I lived in Chicago and Orlando, we visited each other and kept our friendship strong.  Ever since Jung moved back to the bay area, we have been inseparable.  Jung and I also have a special bond of being born on the same day.
								-->
								<tr><td>Monica An</td></tr>
								<!--
								Monica is my new sister in law.  Monica is sweet and loving - she played the vital role in organizing the entire proposal and the engagement party for us.  She is exact kind of younger sister I have always wanted.  We are also very similar in many ways.  We have similar humor, both grew up figure skating, and love to dance and try out different types of food!

								<tr><td>Dan Kim (Best Man)</td></tr>
								<!--
								Also known as DK. This man has been truly an inspiration in my life. Through thick and thin, he has been there for me. I knew that Dan would be the best man at my wedding one day, and time can only tell how far we've come. I am so thankful for a friend like Dan. 
								-->
								<tr><td>Matthew Motia</td></tr>
								<!--
								I truly cherish my friendship with Matt. He is the most humble and down to earth guy I know. Matt made an impact on the person I am today, and I look to him for advice and guidance in a lot of aspects of life. He has always been a rock solid friend, and I am excited for my kid
								-->
								<tr><td>Colin McQuay</td></tr>
								<!--
								Colin is just a stand-up guy. He is the most competitive, but also has every reason to be because he is actually good at everything he does (most of the time - unless he cheats his way through). I learned a great deal from Colin - he has always been a friend that I can count on for solid advice and integrity. I can't wait until my kids beat his kids in every sport.
								-->
								<tr><td>Craig Ballard</td></tr>
								<!--
								Craig has always been a friend who has always been there for me. His generosity and friendship has carried me a long way. I don't know who I would have become with the support and love from this man. He has always been an amazing friend to me, and I am so thankful for him.
								-->
								<tr><td>Alex Yassine</td></tr>
								<!--
								Alex is the one to thank for the success I have had in my career and my move to San Francisco - which ultimately led to me meeting Nikki. When I met Alex my freshman in college, I knew right away he would fit with my group of friends, and hence we've all been friends ever since. I am super thankful for him, as he has always been a friend that I can rely and trust wholeheartedly.
