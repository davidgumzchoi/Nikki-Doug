			  		<h4>Bride</h4>
			  		<h3>Nikki Lee</h3>
			  		<p>Doug and I met at church and got to know each other better during our drive up from SoCal to San Francisco after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Since I don't have a car in SoCal, Doug graciously offered to pick me up from home to drive up together with other church friends. When Doug was on his way, I decided to prep my mom and let her know that a boy was coming over to the Lee household since she can be overbearing at times. I let her know that Doug was just a buddy giving me a lift, and nothing more. But as soon as Doug met my mom, my mom whispered in my ear and said, "He seems like such a good boy.  I've always wanted you to be with a guy like that." My heart secretly melted then.</p> 
	          <p>One of my prayer requests for my future husband has always been to meet someone who can love my mom and vice versa. My mom is such an important person in my life so I wanted someone who can share that special bond and join in our family. Since our long drive up to San Francisco, Doug has been fully committed in getting to know me and in working on our relationship. I was skeptical at first but the more I got to know him, the more I couldn't believe how God brought the very person with qualities I had always prayed for in my future husband. It still amazes me at times how God answered my prayer on even the most detailed aspects of Doug's characteristics.</p>
            <p>As one of our first dates, we went for a day snowboarding/ski trip to Tahoe. We were excited for the long drive of us getting to know each other better and ski and snowboard since we both haven't done so in a long time. However during our first run down, Doug fell and hit his head against a pile of ice and got a concussion. He was carried down the mountain on a toboggan by the first aid patrols and we soon ended up in the ER nearby. I was obviously worried as I was sitting in the ER waiting room, but as tears were coming down my face, I realized I cared for him a lot and loved him. We became "official" that day in the ER. Looking back, funny how everything worked out. I used to always wonder why God hadn't sent me someone already. I now know why it took so long - because He had Doug in store for me.</p>

          	<h3>Douglas An</h3>
            <p>I don't know if Nikki remembers the first time we met, but it was at our church's annual retreat. She was standing waiting in line to get prayed by a pastor, and I had just come up and stood right in front of her (obviously an honest mistake because I'm a good human being).  She tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "get in line" (as she crinkled her face in annoyance).</p>
            <p>The first time I met Nikki, I must say, was quite different from the lovey-dovey cloud 9 love at first sight. The way she caught my eye was with her confidence. We were able to drive together after a birthday in the east bay - the first real conversation we shared. We parked outside her apartment sat in my car for about an hour just talking - goals, aspirations, career, etc. I knew then - I wanted to get to know her better.</p>
            <p>Soon thereafter, I had the opportunity to pick her up from Fullerton to drive back up to San Francisco. We got a chance to share a conversation, until meeting up with the other people that we were supposed to drive up with. I felt such an urge to get to know her. I felt compassion over her immediately and I wanted to finally ask her on a date. The more I got to know her the more I fell in love with her.</p>
            <p>Fast forward a couple months. We decided to wait until March to officially date, and once that day came, I knew right away - I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person. It wasn't what she looks like, her desires, her interests. No, it was all icing on the cake. I knew the way I felt about her was real. I knew that I couldn't let her go, and envisioning my life without her was impossible.</p>
            <p>So, on May 24th, I proposed to her on Mount Tamapais, where we went on our first date, in front of her mom and friends.</p>
            <p>I'm excited for us to continue to write our story as we enter into the next chapter of life together.</p>

			        			<p>Alex is the one to thank for the success I have had in my career and my move to San Francisco - which ultimately led to me meeting Nikki. When I met Alex my freshman in college, I knew right away he would fit with my group of friends, and hence we've all been friends ever since. I am super thankful for him, as he has always been a friend that I can rely and trust wholeheartedly.</p>

								Ever since Nikki and I met, we have talked about traveling the world. With our personalities being adventurous and loving the outdoors (I even proposed on a mountain!), it has been both of our dreams to visit and experience one of the seven wonders of the world - hiking Machu Picchu followed by a relaxing time on the beach. Rather than the typical home goods registry, we would love for you to contribute in making their honeymoon dream come true.
